The associated scripts are built by the Butter team to leverage a headless user browser session in Python that will automate the generation and downloading of the reports that fall within the range specified by the script runner.

**Prerequisite:** Download each of the following scripts from the relevant Butter repository on GitHub, and place them all into the same local directory on your computer:

1. Adyen_Queue_Reports.py
2. Adyen_Download_Reports.py
3. Session_Variables.py

## Follow the numbered steps below to configure and run the scripts...

1. Sign in to your Adyen customer area (dashboard) using your Adyen credentials<br /><br />
2. Once you are signed in to Adyen, click on the “**Reports**” link found in the left navigation bar.<br /><br />
3. Once the Reports page has loaded, we can begin to use the developer tools. (The following screenshots show this being done on a Google Chrome browser.)<br /><br />
4. Click on the three vertical dots in the upper right corner of your browser window, and navigate to the **“More Tools**” section, and select that “**Developer Tools**” option.

    <br />
5. The Chrome Developer Tools will either show as a sidebar or new window. This depends on your hardware.<br /><br />
6. Select the “**Network**” tab
    
    ![Screenshot 2024-08-14 at 10.21.07 AM.png](/adyen/images/screenshots/2.png)
    <br />

7. When the network tab has loaded, select the black / white circle icon (it will turn red) to make sure that it is recording the requests being made.

    <br />
    
8. Select the filter (indicated by the funnel icon)→ and select the “**Fetch/XHR**” option. These are the network calls the website is using to load data, and they will be mimicked by the Python scripts.

    <br />
    
9. Select any network call (such as “**newnotificationcount”**), right click on it, select “**Copy”**, and then select “**Copy as cURL**”

    <br />
    
10. We recommend using a cURL converter (like the one found at [https://curlconverter.com](https://curlconverter.com/)) to convert a cURL command to Python.
    
    ![Screenshot 2024-08-14 at 10.25.29 AM.png](/adyen/images/screenshots/6.png)
    <br />
    
11. Using the Python code that has been outputted by the cURL coverter, copy ONLY the “**cookies = {….}**” object and “**headers = {…}**” object content into the file named ***“Session_Variables.py”***
    1. These values only contain details of your currently logged-in web session. They also contain a token (JSESSIONID) that validates that your session is authenticated, and properties containing details of the “browser” and site that we are using.
    <br />
12. Replace the “**cookies**” and “**headers**” values with the values that were copied to your clipboard from the cURL converter page, and paste the values in their corresponding places in `Session_Variables.py`. Be careful not to replace any of the values found below the “headers” object, such as. `number_of_days` or `end_date`.
    
    ![Screenshot 2024-08-14 at 10.26.56 AM.png](/adyen/images/screenshots/7.png)
    <br />
    
13. Set the `number_of_days` variable to the number of days for which we want to generate and download reports
    1. This value needs to be an integer above 0
    <br />

14. Set the `end_date` variable to reflect the current date, following the format of YYYY-MM-DD. (Example: August 14, 2024 would be represented as 2024-08-14)<br /><br />

15. Make sure that Python 3.10.x is installed
    1. _Instructions for Mac OS users:_
        1. Ensure your system has Homebrew installed for package management. It can be found at [https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh)
        2. Use the following homebrew command to install the Python version
            1. `brew install python@3.10`
        3. Modify your shell RC script (like `~/.zshrc`) by adding each of the following items on their own line:
            1. export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.10:$PATH
            2. alias python="/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.10”
            3. alias pip="/opt/homebrew/bin/pip3.10”
        4. Close and re-open the terminal, which should make the previously set variables available use
            1. This can be confirmed by typing “which python”, and the terminal should return the above path to python (”/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.10”)<br /><br />
    2. _Instructions for Windows users:_
        1. The relevant version of python can be found at [https://python.org/downloads/release/python-31011](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011)<br /><br />
        2. Determine if you are running a 32-bit or a 64-bit architecture<br /><br />
        3. Select the appropriate package and install it<br /><br />
    3. Validate after installation completes by running the standalone command `python` in your terminal. Confirm that it reflects version `3.10.x` in its output.
        _The terminal output should resemble the following:_
        ```
        Python 3.10.13 (main, Aug 24 2023, 12:59:26) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.1.0.2.5)] on darwin
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>..
        ```
        * Type **exit()** to quit.
        <br />
16. Make sure that any required python dependencies are installed.
    1. Run the command `pip install requests`
    <br />
17. Use the terminal to navigate to the directory where you downloaded all of the scripts.
<br />
18. Configure your base download URL by setting the `base_url` variable in the `Session_Variables.py` file:
    1. Your base URL can be found as part of the full URL of any page **after** you have logged in to your Adyen custome area.
    2. For example, when Butter's engineers log in to their Adyen customer area, they are taken to the default overview (home) page of the dashboard.<br />
        The URL for this is [https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/overview/default.shtml](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/overview/default.shtml).<br/>
        This means that the base URL for a Butter engineer would be **`ca-test.adyen.com`**.
        <br />
19. Run the command `python Adyen_Queue_Reports.py`
    1. This will request Adyen to generate the reports and prepare them for download
    2. This can take some time for them to actually create data
    3. “Queued Failure”can mean no data available or already generated
    <br />
20. Wait for the execution of the `Adyen_Queue_Reports.py` python script to complete.
<br />
21. Run the command `python Adyen_Download_Reports.py`
    1. This will download the reports that have been generated for each day that falls between the value set for `end_date` and the number of days prior to the end date, which can be found in the `number_of_days` variable.
    <br />
22. Wait for the execution of the `Adyen_Download_Reports.py` python script to complete.
<br />
23. Observe that the files have been downloaded into the same directory from where the Python scripts were stored and executed.
<br />
24. Confirm that the downloads were successful by manually downloading one of the reports, and comparing it to the matching report found in the folder where script downloaded the bulk files.
<br />
25. You’re all done and ready to share the reports!

## Sharing the Reports
Butter will provision an SFTP directory for file transfer. Please provide your Butter contact with a public SSH key and the IP address of the server or device from which you will be connecting.
